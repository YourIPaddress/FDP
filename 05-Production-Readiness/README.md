📘 MODEL EVALUATION WORKBOOK
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;">

This workbook introduces the most important evaluation metrics in Machine Learning using a simple, guided, and beginner-friendly Python template.
It is specially designed for MBA faculty and non-coding learners.

You will learn how to measure the quality of a model, not just how to train one.
Everything is hands-on and visual!

🔍 1. What is Model Evaluation?
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;">

Model Evaluation helps us understand how well a machine learning model performs on real business tasks.
When predicting Hit_Target (Yes/No), the model may make:

🟦 Correct predictions

🟥 Wrong predictions

Evaluation metrics help measure these outcomes clearly and meaningfully.

Model evaluation makes your model:

Accurate → correct overall

Precise → fewer false positives

Sensitive → catches true positives

Balanced → F1-score

Interpretable → confusion matrix

📂 2. What Data Are We Using?
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;">

We continue using:

sales_data.csv


This ensures a smooth and consistent learning flow.

It contains:

Month

Region

Product Category

Revenue

Units Sold

Marketing Spend

Monthly Sales

Hit_Target (Yes/No) ← Classification label

Hit_Target is what we predict in this module.

</div>
🧪 3. What Metrics Will You Learn?
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.7;">
✔ Accuracy

Overall correctness.

✔ Precision

How many predicted “Yes” are actually “Yes”?

✔ Recall

How many real “Yes” customers were caught?

✔ F1-Score

Balance between precision & recall.

✔ Confusion Matrix

Visual summary of correct & incorrect predictions.

</div>
🧠 4. Why These Metrics Matter for Business?
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;">

Understanding these scores helps managers make decisions like:

Should we trust the ML model?

How many customers did we wrongly classify?

How many actual churn/target-achievers did we miss?

How reliable is our sales prediction system?

These metrics connect Machine Learning to business KPIs.

</div>
📘 5. Hands-On Notebook: validation_metrics.ipynb
<hr> <div style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;">

You will perform step-by-step:

Load the CSV

Convert Hit_Target to numeric

Preprocess (encode + scale)

Train Logistic Regression

Predict on test data

Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1

Visualize Confusion Matrix

Clear explanations included inside the notebook.

</div>
🎉 6. Output

At the end you will have:

✔ A trained classification model

✔ All evaluation metrics

✔ Confusion matrix visualization

✔ Ability to interpret ML performance

✔ Business understanding of errors

</div>
🚀 7. End-to-End Progress
